<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages. Learning how to create my own website. It is a bit challenging at the moment. 
Currently, at the initial stages, but at least a link is up. </p>

<p> How do I establish links or subcategories?</p>
<p> More information about myself: A student at UBC, majors in Economics and Mathematics. Much anticipated blog on politics and etc
on Singapore and Southeast Asia.</p>
